PEAS (example: autonomous car)

To design a rational agent, we must specifu the task environment,
which consists of the following four things:

1. Performance evaluation (follow traffic laws, minimize fuel/time, safety)
2. Environment  (roads, pedestrians etc)
3. Actuators  (what an agent can do: speakers, motors etc)
4. Sensors    (cameras, sonars etc)

Environment types: dimensions of complexity

Dimension                     Possible values
Observable?                   full (chess) vs partial (poker)
Deterministic?                deterministic (chess) vs stochastic
Episodic?                     episodic vs. sequential
Static?                       static vs. dynamic (semidynamic)
Discrete?                     discrete vs. continuous
Number of Agents              single vs. multiple (competetive/cooperative)
